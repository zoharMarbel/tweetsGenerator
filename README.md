in the beginning of God's creation of the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.
And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated between the light and between the darkness.
And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night, and it was evening and it was morning, one day.
And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.
And God made the expanse and it separated between the water that was below the expanse and the water that was above the expanse, and it was so.
And God called the expanse Heaven, and it was evening, and it was morning, a second day.
And God said, "Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear," and it was so.
And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas, and God saw that it was good.
